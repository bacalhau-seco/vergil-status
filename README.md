rubberducky payload

if yo want to add this to a raspberry pi pico you just need to drag the file an drop it inside the pico but remember to connect pin 1 and 3, if you dont the script will run instantly.

the script only works on windows pc i tested it on 10 but maybe works on 7, 8, 8.1 and 11.

Please give me feedback,
enjoy!
