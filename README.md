rubberducky payload

## description

this is a small prank I made, when the USB rubber ducky is plugged into the computer it opens a video of a Vergil combo on youtube and then after a few seconds, it bluescreens the pc!

## how to use

I made this for the raspberry pico so you just need to download the payload.dd file to the pico. 

For a better understanding of using the pico as a USB rubber ducky, you can take a look at the pico-ducky repository: https://github.com/dbisu/pico-ducky

If you are using a rubber ducky you can copy the code in the file and turn it into an inject.bin file using an encoder: https://payloadstudio.hak5.org/community/
