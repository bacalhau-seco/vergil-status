rubberducky payload

this is a small prank i made, when the rubberducky is pluged in the computer it opens a video of a vergil combo on youtube an then after a few seconds it bluescreens the pc!


If yo want to add this to a raspberry pi pico you just need to download the payload.dd file put it inside the pico but remember to connect pin 1 and 3, if you dont the script will run instantly.

If you are using a rubberducky you can copy the code in the file and use an encoder to turn into a rubberducky file.

The script only works on windows pc i tested it on 10 but maybe works on 7, 8, 8.1 and 11.

Please give me feedback,
enjoy!
